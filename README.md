How to:
1) Download the source code;
2) Open CubeIDE and import the token_queue folder;
3) Connect the board to the pc and to whatever input circuit you're using;
4) Either import the micro_communication project on Visual Studio or just run main.py via command line;
5) Upload the code from CubeIDE to the board.

N.B. the main_readable.py and main_readable.c files are meant for easier to the relevant code of the project, if you're only interested in running the code you can ignore them
